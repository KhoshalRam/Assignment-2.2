      The Hadoop Distributed File System is a distributed file system designed to run on a commodity hardware.  
 Hadoop has many similarities with the existing file systems with few significant differences. It is highly fault-tolerant and is
 highly designed to be deployed on relatively inexpensive hardwares. 
 
 Features of HDFS:
      Hardware Failures:
          Hardware failure is the norm rather than exception in distributed file systems. An HDfs
          instance may have or consist of hundreds or thousands of server machines, each storiing a part
          of the file system's data. The fact is that there are a huge number of components and that 
          each components and that each component has a significant probability of failure which 
          means that some component of HDFS is always non-functional.  Thus the architectural goal of HDFS
          is to detect faults quickly and recover automatically .
      
      Streaming Data Acess:
          Applications that run on HDFS need streaming access to their sets. They are not general prupose applications 
          that run on general purpose distributed file systems. It is designed more for batch processing
          rather than interactive use by users. The major aspect is the high data access rather that
          inability to access data.
          
      
      Large Data sets:
          Applications that run on HDFS have large data sets (a collection of related sets of information that is composed of 
          seperate elements but can by manipulated as a single unit by a computer. A typical HDFS file is GB(giga-bytes) 
          and TB(tera-bytes) in size. The HDFS must be able support large volumes of data in a single instance.
         
      Moving Computation is cheaper than Moving data:
          When the size of the data set is huge , the requst of a computation by an application is much more efficient if it is 
          executed near the data it operates on. This minimizes the network congestion an increases the overall processing of the 
          system. 
          
      Portability:
          HDFS is designed in such a way that it is easily portable from one platform to another.
          This helps in the wide-spread adoption of HDFS as a platform of choice for large sets of 
          applications.
